               <p>Lost cause by Beck is probably the first song I <mark class="purple">fell in love</mark> with. I first heard it through the game: beyond: two souls, where it was covered by Ellen Page. The point in the game where Ellen's character was on the run from what I could remember, she crosses a guitarist in the winter, where it was too cold to play, so she asked if she could <mark class="purple">give it a go.</mark></p>
        
               <p>Despite having one of the most uneventful and weird music videos I've ever seen, beck's smooth voice made this song <mark class="purple">timeless</mark> for me.</p>

               <p><em>This song itself is part of my <mark class="purple">coming of age</mark>, learning the guitar, singing along late at night.</em></p>

               <p>I listen to too many <mark class="purple">love</mark> songs, that's probably a bad thing. I guess this song is about someone trying to breakup with someone they no longer love, the other person is a lost cause, he or she is pitied upon, but he or she is not a good person, so no one cares, and despite the singer caring for the person in the past, the singer is now sick of this person's <mark class="purple">bullshit</mark>, and knows that although no one else will take care of this person, he is choosing to let go and move on.</p>
               
               <p>That was really badly written, but I think it's pretty straight forward. Although it is a breakup song, I feel like it is really <mark class="purple">delicately worded</mark>, it has a protective <mark class="purple">warmth</mark>, a gentleness that's spilling out, like the break up <mark class="purple">had to happen</mark>, for everyone's sake.</p>

               <p>Your sorry eyes, they cut through the bone, they make it hard, to leave you alone.</p>
               <p><em><mark class="purple">Baby you're a lost cause.</mark></em></p>
