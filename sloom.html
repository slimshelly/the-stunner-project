                  This was one of the first songs I tried to learn on the guitar, and one of the most confusing songs for me to interpret. The song itself is not very complicated, only a few different chords and keeps the same pace throughout, but the lyrics are so beautifully written it makes me want to <mark class="gentle">cry</mark> just reading it.
<br>
<br>
Reading online, some people think this song is a <mark class="gentle">happiness</mark> song, but I feel like this is a song about going through a really difficult time but still <mark class="gentle">pushing forward</mark>. The two vocalists sing one after another and it seems like they are talking to each other, but I don't think that's the case. I think that both of them are telling their own stories, not related, but in a similar context. 
<br>
<br>
<em>The books that I keep by my bed, are full of your <mark class="gentle">stories</mark>, that I drew up from, a little dream of mine, a little <mark class="gentle">nightmare</mark> of yours.</em>
<br>
<br>
This is a cute verse, but I really can't seem to figure out the meaning, or wether it's suppose to be a positive or a negative saying. 
<br>
<br>
<em>The cat's silhouette, as big as a monster. </em>This makes me picture a child lying in bed late at night staring at the wall, and a cat’s shadow is casted upon the wall looking like a giant scary monster. I think this talks about how in rough times, something small can be <mark class="gentle">amplified</mark> to oblivion just because your brain lets it. 
<br>
<br>

<em>I met a man today, and he smiled back at me, now there are thoughts like these, that keep me on my feet. </em>
<br>
<br>
This final bit shows how much of a difference a tiny gesture from a stranger can mean to anyone else, something as trivial as a <mark class="gentle">smile</mark> can keep a person going.
<br>
<br>

Sloom apparently is the plural of of <mark class="gentle">doze</mark>. You're seeing everything through a layer of <mark class="gentle">dreamy fog</mark>, when you're in this sloom, but you can keep auto piloting on, <mark class="gentle">because you're a human</mark>.
