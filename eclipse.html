               <p>Eclipse is a super <mark class="lime">enigma</mark>tic song in my opinion. It was only released on soundcloud and youtube but not on spotify, so I don't have a copy of it on my phone, which sucks a lot. The song itself is really simple and straightforward. The chorus and electronic bits are super super catchy, it was apparently all mixed by elohim herself, which makes this even more impressive. The song itself of course is very well written, it's depicting a <mark class="lime">simple</mark> indulgence in a person just for the time being, until something happens. It's like <mark class="lime">magic</mark>, a kick to the head, it's like <mark class="lime">acid</mark>, thinning my blood.
