               <p class='intro'>The starting guitar bit sounds to me just like an <mark class="pink">engine</mark> starting, the album cover is drawn so elegantly, I can just imagine driving at night and blasting this song.</p>

                  "Turn" to me, is a love song (no shit). It illustrates the <mark class="pink">ups</mark> and <mark class="pink">downs</mark> of a relationship, of a slice of life that makes you feel <mark class="pink">alive</mark>. I like the way you turn me inside and out, maybe it's the crazy that I'd miss, baby it's the crazy I like.

                "Turn" is what a relationship should be like to me, it doesn't have to be all smooth sailing, and it doesn't have to be your soul mate or your true love whatever, but it should make you mad and crazy, and it should make you feel alive, where when you look back on it, the good and the bad, the rough and the smooth, it happened, and that's what life is. You're in for a ride. Watering plastic plants, smashing your phone, you're going <mark class="pink">insane</mark> because of this person.

                  Baby, it's the crazy I like <br>
                  I think I saw the world turn in your eyes <br>
                  Baby, it's the crazy I like <br>
                  And maybe it's the bullshit I'd miss <br>
                  Screaming at the moon in black lipstick <br>
                  Maybe it's the bullshit I'd miss<br>
