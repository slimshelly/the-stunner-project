<p>This song will always hold a special place in my <mark class="glitter">heart</mark>. This was the first "The Wombats" song I've ever heard and I fell in love straight away. I discovered this quite literal gem by using discover weekly (I am forever grateful spotify) for the first time, it was a bit into boarding and I was feeling beyond shit, but this song popped into my ears one day during prep time. The almost bell like keyboard sounds at the start matched with the guitar made me fall in love straight away. Funny thing is, for the better part of a few years, I <mark class="glitter">didn't even care</mark> what the lyrics said, and I still don’t. The song itself is just so catchy, you don't need the lyrics to swing and nod your head around with it. She hits like <mark class="glitter">ecstasy</mark>, comes up and bangs the sense out of me. I also didn't realise this was a love song. I didn’t know what it was, and I didn't really care.

Greek <mark class="glitter">tragedy</mark>, if I remember correctly from studying it in drama, is a story that revolves around the main character's weakness, which ultimately results in the character's downfall. I guess in this case, the person's weakness is this girl. The album glitterbug also has probably the prettiest album cover I have ever seen, everything about it is aesthetic. I don't really know what else to say about this song, it's <mark class="glitter">perfect.</mark> </p>
