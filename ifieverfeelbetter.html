                 If I ever feel better is just simply the title, if I will ever feel better, will I ever feel better. 
This is the second song I have from Phoenix after J-Boy, it has the same upbeat tempo and tune but the contents are completely different. If I ever feel better is a song about the <mark class="silver">suffocating</mark> loneliness that you feel at the lower points of your life. It questions whether you will ever bounce back, and with the world around you spinning out of <mark class="silver">control</mark>, what can you do other than to just accept the fact that you're <mark class="silver">fucked</mark>. 

<br>
<br>
"I'm losing my balance on the tightrope, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please."

<br>
<br>
We're always desperately searching for someone to give us the <mark class="silver">answer</mark>, and when life gets hard, that's even more obviously the case, since no one taught you how to live, we're all just going off what we hope is right. 

<br>
<br>
You can see this as a break up song, especially from the chorus, but I don't think that's the key point, the thing is, you can be catching up with anyone that you like when you're feeling <mark class="silver">better</mark>. The fact is, you're trying to mark this moment, this second right now, so that the next time you see who ever you're talking to, you'll be better, you'll improve and be happy, this is what you desperately hope, that <mark class="silver">everything will be alright</mark>, and you will feel better in time. 

<br>
<br>
<em>"I'm feeding the enemy." </em>
The enemy is always yourself, and you're giving into your own sorrows and self pity, you feel like you can't recover. <br><br>
<em>"Blame me for what's happening, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try."</em> Self blame and general repetition of your own self hate makes it that much harder to imagine a brighter future. 

<br>
<br>
No one knows the hard times I went through and if happiness came I missed the call 

<br>
<br>

<em>"Someday this mess will make me laugh, <mark class="silver">I can't wait</mark>, I can't wait, I can't wait."</em>

<br>
<br>
This is the best line, as it is the most truthfully wholesome line, one day you'll get past all this, and leave it behind you, you'll look back and think to yourself what a shitty time it was, and also how you stressed over the stupid things when they <mark class="silver">didn't matter</mark>.

<br>
<br>
Yeah, I guess no matter how shitty things seem right now, it will get better in time as long as you don't give up.

<br>
<br>
<mark class="silver">If I ever feel better, remind me to spend some good time with you. </mark>
