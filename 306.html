                  Oh <mark class="high">fuck it</mark> let's go have some fun. 
<br><br>
HONNE is a special band. I first heard them through discover weekly sometime during high school, I remember walking home past Gillespie Field and "Someone that loves you" started playing.
<br><br>
This song witnessed one of the biggest <mark class="high">changes</mark> to my inner self up to this point in life. I was in a rough place, coming back from Shanghai to Beijing, trying to find some sort of <mark class="high">purpose</mark> to my life. This song filled my late night orange light filled walks through the dark alleys, slightly drunk from whisky and high on life. I don't know what a 306 is, but I'm assuming it's a car. "You probably heard me when I drove right past, windows down money trees on full blast." I can totally imagine this, a shitty ass car <mark class="high">blasting</mark> loud music during late nights. This song embodied my <mark class="high">anticipation</mark> of college. It was a bit over a month before the start of college and I couldn't wait. The car was his tool to his freedom, to go anywhere and everywhere. My <mark class="high">freedom</mark> was so close. 
<br><br>
Listening to HONNE live in Beijing, as this song came on, I cried. I <mark class="high">screamed</mark> my lungs out the entire song, it was the first time I have ever cried with <mark class="high">joy</mark>. It was total <mark class="high">bliss</mark>.
<br><br>
<em>
You probably knew me more than anyone here <br>
Well you were pretty much my teenage years
</em>
<br><br>
The car in this case to me could also be seen as my sadness and sorrows, which <mark class="high">followed</mark> me throughout my life no matter what. I guess that's the same with everyone, I think it is true that my sadness knew me more than anyone here. 
<br><br>
This song is one of my 9 fav favs songs, it captured a moment in my <mark class="high">timeline</mark> where I was actually excited for the future.
<br><br>
Not a love song yay!!!!!
