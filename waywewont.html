                  This is not a love song, surprisingly. I'd like to think this is a song that shows off <mark class="blue">youth</mark>. I'm not a fan of Grandaddy as this is honestly the only song I like from them, but I really like it. The <mark class="blue">electronic</mark> riffs during the chorus is just so hopeful. Tropical smells, back to school sales, why would we ever move. This song makes me <mark class="blue">imagine</mark>, I think about what my life would be like if I was born in America, and grew up there, in a small town perhaps, with an uneventful life, but a hopeful one. This song makes me want to drive away from all my problems, just keep going. I'm not really sure if this song is about not moving away from home or just not moving back, but it sounds both like nostalgia of home but also the <mark class="blue">excitement</mark> of what the future holds. I guess in the end that’s the essence of what I feel, the freedom of youth, of having your life ahead, and living without <mark class="blue">burdens</mark>(?).
