na&middot;dir<br>
/'n&#257;d&#601;r,&#712;n&#257;dir/<br>
noun
</mark>
<br><br>
noun: nadir; plural noun: nadirs <br>
the <mark class="bright">lowest</mark> point in the fortunes of a person or organization.
<br><br>
This song was actually so dramatically timed for my life, I felt I probably did reach the lowest point of my life at the start of my time in Beijing summer 2018. I had just started working at Bricks, I felt lost, lonely and bored all the time. <mark class="bright">Nothing was happening. </mark>
<br><br>
TENDER stuck with me during my highs and lows in Shanghai as well, I can still picture me stumbling back to my room at 1 or 2 AM, drunk on cocktails and blasting this song. 
Nadir talks about the end of an relationship where both parties <mark class="bright">resent</mark> each other. 
<br><br>
This song is not too abstract but seriously beautifully written, they are at this point only staying together for the appearances and <mark class="bright">comfort</mark> of having someone, there is no <mark class="bright">love</mark>.
<br><br>
Who're we kidding but ourselves? This is the end.
<br><br>
<em>
This is our divide <br>
Need to go our separate ways, I'm too scared if you stay<br>
We'll hold another grudge, who am I to judge?<br>
If I will wake up one day and miss you too much<br>
Yeah, we play with high stakes, it's a risk I need to take<br>
Dirty beds and motels, <mark class="bright">cast your spell on someone else</mark> </em><br><br>
